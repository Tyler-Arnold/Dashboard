# The Dashboard 
This is the front end for the house wallboard.
# Getting her going
You'll need to restore the node dependencies with 'npm install' and aquire the secrets or you'll be missing some key files and it will not build.
Then npm run prod to package the typescript and output the app.js. Then just run through IIS in visual studio or dotnet run.
# Pending TODO's
- webpack dev server with hot reloading
- putting the API url in config with corresponding dev urls
- More tiles
